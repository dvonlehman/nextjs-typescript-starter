# Steller Web Player

This is a prototype of a new Steller web player built using [next.js](https://next.js). The goals of this new approach are as follows:

- Leverage Next.js for routing, server-rendering, and other UI infrastructure rather than rolling our own
- Utilize a model where each device category (desktop, phone, TV??) essentially has it's own app rather than relying primarily on CSS media queries. It's still one Node app on the server, but there is a dedicated webpack bundle for each device category. We can still have common components that are shared across devices.
-

## Approach

Rather than utilizing babel to compile the TypeScript, we instead configure Next.js to only know about the build output generated by the TypeScript compiler `tsc`. Since Next.js is working with compiled sources, we don't need any babel plugins or presets, so these are cleared out in the `.babelrc`. The `npm dev` command runs two processes in parallel: `tsc` with the `--watch` option to continuously re-compile TypeScript source files, and `node server.js` where `server.js` is a built file.

### Debugging

#### Sourcemaps

We effectively have a two step build process, first
